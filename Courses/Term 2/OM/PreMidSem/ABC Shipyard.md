# 📄 **ABC SHIPYARD FACILITY LAYOUT CASE REPORT**

## **Executive Summary**

ABC Shipyard has received an order to build **five 55,000 DWT Handymax ships within two years**. However, the current layout and operating model has led to **excessive work-in-progress**, **space congestion**, and **low throughput**, primarily due to lack of alignment between steel processing and block erection requirements. Analysis of **REL charts** from the provided Excel workbook shows that the **required layout** significantly improves shop proximities, reduces process travel distance, and supports continuous workflow. Applying **Theory of Constraints (TOC)** and converting the steel shop to **virtual cellular manufacturing** will reduce WIP, cycle time, and increase throughput—allowing ABC Shipyard to accept the new order.

---

## **Case Background**

ABC Shipyard builds medium-sized vessels and currently delivers **four ships per year**. Receiving a new order for five additional Handymax bulk carriers requires faster throughput. However, large volumes of semi-finished blocks in the block-erection area are preventing work from proceeding, causing delays.

The main cause is departmental focus on **individual KPIs** instead of **system throughput**, particularly in the steel shop, where batch processing leads to a mismatch between steel plate types produced and block erection needs.

---

## **Problem Statement**

### **Why can’t ABC Shipyard currently accept the order?**

- Block erection area is completely filled with unfinished blocks
    
- Steel shop production is not synchronized with block erection requirements
    
- Layout causes inefficient movement between major processing shops
    
- Bottleneck (block erection area) is not fully utilized
    
- Excessive WIP blocks workflow and space
    

---

## **Root Cause Analysis**

|Symptom|Root Cause|
|---|---|
|High WIP|Steel shop batch cutting without coordinating needs|
|Congestion of block erection area|Too many blocks started, few finished|
|Poor cycle time|Long movement travel distance|
|Reduced throughput|Bottleneck starvation due to poor synchronization|

---

## **Applying Theory of Constraints**

- **Identified bottleneck:** Block Erection Area
    
- **TOC Principle:** All upstream operations should support bottleneck utilization
    
- **Policy change required:** Steel cutting must be driven by erection area pull signals, not steel shop KPI maximization
    
- **Expected Output:** Reduced WIP, improved output flow, increased throughput
    

---

## **Solution: Layout Redesign Using REL Chart Analysis**

From the Excel sheets:

- Comparative **Adjusted Distance (AD)** and **Total Distance (TD)** values show that the **required layout** is significantly closer to the **ideal** than the **existing layout**
    
- Improves adjacency of critical operations
    

|Area Pair|Existing Proximity|Required Proximity|Improvement|
|---|---|---|---|
|Steel → Paint|Far|Close|Reduced transport|
|Pipe shop → Sub-assembly|Far|Close|Faster outfitting|
|Warehouse → Outfitting|Far|Close|Faster parts supply|

### **Proposed Changes**

1. **Create virtual product cells inside the steel shop:**
    
    - Flat block line
        
    - Curved block line
        
2. **Reposition shops based on required layout:**
    
    - Move paint shop closer to steel shop
        
    - Move pipe shop near sub-assembly
        
    - Move warehouse near outfitting & general purpose shop
        
3. **Adopt TOC scheduling to prioritize bottleneck feeding**

## **Expected Outcomes**

|Before|After|
|---|---|
|High WIP and space blockage|Low WIP and continuous block completion|
|Long transport travel|Shortest-distance material movement|
|Frequent idle time at bottleneck|Highest bottleneck utilization|
|Poor throughput (4 ships/year)|Higher throughput enabling delivery of 5 ships in 2 years|

# 📘 **Answers to DOC Assignment Questions**

### **1. Definition of Facility Layout**

Facility layout is the physical arrangement of machinery, departments, workforce, inventory storage and supporting services to ensure an efficient workflow and minimal handling costs, maximizing productivity.

---

### **2. Types of Facility Layout & Their Application at ABC**

|Layout Type|About|Where in ABC|
|---|---|---|
|Process Layout|Similar equipment grouped|Steel, Pipe, Paint, General Purpose shops|
|Product Layout|Sequential operations arranged linearly|Proposed flat & curved processing lines|
|Fixed-Position Layout|Product stays in one place, resources move|Block Erection Area, Dock, Quay|
|Cellular Layout|Families of products processed in cells|Proposed virtual cells in steel shop|

Factors determining layout choice: product type, volume, flexibility, handling cost, bottleneck location, space.

---

### **3. Impact of TOC + Product Layout on WIP & Throughput**

- WIP decreases due to synchronized flow
    
- Bottleneck stays fully utilized
    
- Throughput increases
    
- Cycle time decreases
    
- Material flow becomes faster
    

---

### **4. What is a REL Chart?**

A relationship (REL) chart shows the desired closeness between facilities based on frequency and importance of interactions. It uses ranking codes (A, E, I, O, U, X).

Factors considered:

- Material flow
    
- Handling frequency
    
- Safety & hazardous risks
    
- Labour sharing
    
- Utilities & supervision needs
    

---

### **5. REL Chart Comparison Results**

`Ideal Layout > Required Layout > Existing Layout`

Required layout gives major improvement in flow direction and minimizes distance.

---

### **6. Practical and Monetary Limitations**

|Practical|Financial|
|---|---|
|Must stop production to shift machines|Infrastructure moving cost|
|Crane access constraints|Cost of creating new foundations|
|Retraining workforce|Setup & opportunity cost during downtime|
|Space constraints|Capital approval needed|

---

# **Final Recommendation**

Based on REL chart analysis and TOC principles, the **Required layout should be implemented**. It is operationally justified and financially viable due to direct cycle time reduction and higher throughput. ABC Shipyard **should accept the order for five Handymax ships** with confidence.
