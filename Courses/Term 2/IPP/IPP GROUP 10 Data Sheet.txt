**Faculty:** Prof. Lakshmi Parvathy

## **1. Policy Problem Identified**

The IIM Sirmaur campus is experiencing repeated dog bite incidents due to an uncontrolled stray dog population. Despite the presence of a “no pets on campus” rule, weak enforcement and conflicting stakeholder behaviour have resulted in safety risks, anxiety among campus residents, and unclear responsibility for medical costs. This represents a case of **policy paralysis**, where rules exist but fail to deliver public welfare. 

---

## **2. Nature of the Problem: A Wicked Policy Issue**

* The problem is **complex and multi-dimensional**, involving public safety, animal welfare, ethics, and governance.
* There is no single authority with clear ownership of the issue.
* Solutions that favour one stakeholder group often generate resistance from another.
* Outcomes are uncertain and politically sensitive.

This qualifies the issue as a **“wicked policy problem”** rather than a simple administrative failure. 

---

## **3. Policy Context and Theoretical Framework**

The analysis is grounded in key public policy concepts:

* **Social Contract Theory:** The administration is responsible for managing collective spaces and ensuring safety.
* **Commons Theory (Ostrom):** The campus functions as a shared resource where individual actions affect collective outcomes.
* **Prisoner’s Dilemma:** Compassionate individual actions (feeding dogs) unintentionally increase collective risk.
* **Market/Policy Failure:** The absence of institutional medical coverage shifts risk unfairly onto individuals. 

---

## **4. Existing Policy and Implementation Gap**

* **Policy in place:** “No pets on campus” rule.
* **Implementation failure:** Selective non-compliance and lack of enforcement.
* **Governance gap:** Campus rules conflict with state-level animal welfare mandates, creating enforcement ambiguity.
* **Outcome:** Increased bite incidents and unresolved liability concerns. 

---

## **5. Stakeholder Mapping**

The conflict involves three major interest groups:

1. **Campus Administration:** Focused on liability management and rule enforcement.
2. **Safety-Focused Students & Staff:** Concerned about physical safety, fear, and medical costs.
3. **Animal-Sympathy Students:** Prioritize ethical treatment, feeding, and oppose relocation.

The absence of coordinated action among these groups perpetuates policy paralysis. 

---

## **6. Evidence and Data Sources**

* District-level dog bite statistics from Himachal Pradesh indicating high incidence rates.
* Formal written complaints from students and staff documenting bite incidents and fear.
* State-level policy updates following Supreme Court directives on dog registration, vaccination, and local accountability.
* Institutional guidelines on emergency medical access (DDU Hospital, Shimla). 

---

## **7. Policy Tools and Approach**

* **Behavioural Policy Tools:** Nudges and human-centred design instead of strict mandates.
* **Customer Journey Mapping:** Tracking the “incident-to-recovery” experience of bite victims.
* **Agile Policy Design:** Using user-centred evidence to correct uninsured risk exposure.
* **Collective Action Framework:** Aligning stakeholder incentives to protect the commons. 

---

## **8. Intended Policy Outcome**

* Reduction in bite incidents.
* Clear allocation of responsibility for prevention and treatment.
* Balance between safety mandates and ethical animal treatment.
* Shift from reactive response to proactive risk management.
