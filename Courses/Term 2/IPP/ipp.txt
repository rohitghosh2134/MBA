# **DATA SHEET**

**Course:** Introduction to Public Policy
**Institute:** Indian Institute of Management, Sirmaur
**Project Title:** *Whose Responsibility? A Policy-Driven Analysis of Human–Animal Conflict*
**Faculty:** Prof. Lakshmi Parvathy

---

## **1. Policy Problem Identified**

The IIM Sirmaur campus is experiencing repeated dog bite incidents due to an uncontrolled stray dog population. Despite the presence of a “no pets on campus” rule, weak enforcement and conflicting stakeholder behaviour have resulted in safety risks, anxiety among campus residents, and unclear responsibility for medical costs. This represents a case of **policy paralysis**, where rules exist but fail to deliver public welfare. 

---

## **2. Nature of the Problem: A Wicked Policy Issue**

* The problem is **complex and multi-dimensional**, involving public safety, animal welfare, ethics, and governance.
* There is no single authority with clear ownership of the issue.
* Solutions that favour one stakeholder group often generate resistance from another.
* Outcomes are uncertain and politically sensitive.

This qualifies the issue as a **“wicked policy problem”** rather than a simple administrative failure. 

---

## **3. Policy Context and Theoretical Framework**

The analysis is grounded in key public policy concepts:

* **Social Contract Theory:** The administration is responsible for managing collective spaces and ensuring safety.
* **Commons Theory (Ostrom):** The campus functions as a shared resource where individual actions affect collective outcomes.
* **Prisoner’s Dilemma:** Compassionate individual actions (feeding dogs) unintentionally increase collective risk.
* **Market/Policy Failure:** The absence of institutional medical coverage shifts risk unfairly onto individuals. 

---

## **4. Existing Policy and Implementation Gap**

* **Policy in place:** “No pets on campus” rule.
* **Implementation failure:** Selective non-compliance and lack of enforcement.
* **Governance gap:** Campus rules conflict with state-level animal welfare mandates, creating enforcement ambiguity.
* **Outcome:** Increased bite incidents and unresolved liability concerns. 

---

## **5. Stakeholder Mapping**

The conflict involves three major interest groups:

1. **Campus Administration:** Focused on liability management and rule enforcement.
2. **Safety-Focused Students & Staff:** Concerned about physical safety, fear, and medical costs.
3. **Animal-Sympathy Students:** Prioritize ethical treatment, feeding, and oppose relocation.

The absence of coordinated action among these groups perpetuates policy paralysis. 

---

## **6. Evidence and Data Sources**

* District-level dog bite statistics from Himachal Pradesh indicating high incidence rates.
* Formal written complaints from students and staff documenting bite incidents and fear.
* State-level policy updates following Supreme Court directives on dog registration, vaccination, and local accountability.
* Institutional guidelines on emergency medical access (DDU Hospital, Shimla). 

---

## **7. Policy Tools and Approach**

* **Behavioural Policy Tools:** Nudges and human-centred design instead of strict mandates.
* **Customer Journey Mapping:** Tracking the “incident-to-recovery” experience of bite victims.
* **Agile Policy Design:** Using user-centred evidence to correct uninsured risk exposure.
* **Collective Action Framework:** Aligning stakeholder incentives to protect the commons. 

---

## **8. Intended Policy Outcome**

* Reduction in bite incidents.
* Clear allocation of responsibility for prevention and treatment.
* Balance between safety mandates and ethical animal treatment.
* Shift from reactive response to proactive risk management.

# **REFLECTIVE NOTE**

This project provided a practical understanding of how public policy functions—or fails—at the implementation level. While studying the stray dog issue at IIM Sirmaur, it became evident that policy problems are rarely caused by the absence of rules. Instead, they emerge from **conflicting interpretations, ethical disagreements, and weak enforcement mechanisms**.

The case highlighted the limitations of rule-based governance. Although a “no pets on campus” policy exists, it does not account for human emotions, ethical concerns, or behavioural realities. Well-intentioned actions such as feeding stray dogs, while morally driven, demonstrated how individual empathy can unintentionally undermine collective safety.

A key learning from this project was the concept of **uninsured risk**. Victims of dog bites bear the physical, emotional, and financial burden, despite the administration’s role as the manager of collective space. This exposed a gap between the theoretical role of the state (or institution) and its practical functioning.

The project also reinforced the importance of **behavioural public policy**. Coercive enforcement alone is insufficient in resolving sensitive issues involving ethics and safety. Nudges, design thinking, and stakeholder engagement offer more sustainable solutions than blanket bans.

Overall, this assignment shifted our perspective from viewing policy as static rules to understanding it as a **dynamic process shaped by human behaviour, institutional capacity, and ethical trade-offs**. It demonstrated that effective public policy requires not only sound design but also empathetic implementation and accountability at the ground level.
