| Strategic Dimension                      | KPMG's Differentiated Approach                                                                                                                                                                                   | Contrast with Big 4/Major Consulting Rivals                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Service Integration                      | Deep Multidisciplinary Integration: KPMG's core differentiator is linking Audit, Tax, and Advisory services seamlessly, particularly in complex areas like M&A, carving out unique value.                        | Rivals often maintain greater separation between audit/compliance and pure strategy practices due to regulatory pressure. KPMG emphasizes the connected solution.                                                                       |

KPMG competes on risk mitigation and reliability alongside innovation.                                                                       |

KPMG ensures its differentiated services are contextually relevant by prioritizing local compliance and industry nuances.                                                    |
KPMG's primary **business-level strategy** is **Broad Differentiation** with a strong focus on **Technology-Enabled Service Integration**.
