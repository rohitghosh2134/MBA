#### 1. Core Competency & Strategy (from Session 5-6)

- **Core Competencies:** Your presentation defines core competence as stemming from "Specialized Resources" and "Co-ordination ability".
    
    - Analyze Sabre's core competency: Is it a _specialized resource_ (its GDS platform, data analytics, and intellectual property)?
        
    - Analyze KPMG's core competency: Is it its _coordination ability_ (its global network of partners, brand reputation, and client-centric model)?
        
- **Business Level Strategy:** The goal is to select a domain and position the company.
    
    - Contrast their strategies. Sabre uses a _Differentiation_ strategy focused on technological innovation and "customer-centric" platforms.
        
    - KPMG also uses a _Differentiation_ strategy, but it is based on "deep industry expertise," brand status, and "dedicated personal assistance".
        
- **Corporate Level Strategy:** This involves searching for new domains, such as _Vertical Integration_ or _Diversification (Related/Unrelated)_.
    
    - Compare their growth paths. Is Sabre's expansion from airline systems to hospitality solutions an example of _related diversification_?
        
    - How does this compare to KPMG's _related diversification_ from its core Audit service into the distinct domains of Tax and Advisory?
        
- **Global Level Strategy:** Compare their international approaches.
    
    - Analyze Sabre's strategy: Is it a _Global_ or _Transnational_ strategy, aiming to provide one "most valued global technology platform"?
        
    - Contrast this with KPMG's structure: Does its "global organization of independent professional services firms" make it a classic example of a _Multi-domestic_ or _Transnational_ strategy, where it must balance global brand standards with local country regulations?
        

#### 2. Organizational Design & Structure (from Session 3-4)

- **Differentiation:** How are tasks divided?
    
    - **Horizontal Differentiation:** Analyze Sabre's structure, which is likely differentiated by _function_ (e.g., "Engineering, Development & Technology," "Sales") and _product_ ("Travel Solutions," "Hospitality Solutions").
        
    - Contrast this with KPMG's _horizontal differentiation_ by _service line_ (Audit, Tax, Advisory) and _industry_.
        
    - **Vertical Differentiation:** Compare the "flat" vs. "tall" nature of Sabre (a tech company) with KPMG's famously tall hierarchical structure (e.g., Analyst to Partner).
        
- **Integration Mechanisms:** How is work coordinated after being differentiated?
    
    - Theorize what mechanisms each uses. Does Sabre rely heavily on _teams_ and _integrating roles_ (like Product Managers) to coordinate its complex platforms?
        
    - How does this compare to KPMG, which uses a _hierarchy of authority_ (partner-led engagements) and _teams_ (client service teams) as its primary integration tools?
        
- **Control Systems (S.O.P. vs. Mutual Adjustment):** How is work controlled?
    
    - Evaluate both companies as _hybrid_ structures.
        
    - **KPMG:** Analyze the high reliance on _S.O.P.s_ (Standard Operating Procedures) in its regulated Audit function versus the high degree of _Mutual Adjustment_ required in its project-based Advisory practice.
        
    - **Sabre:** Analyze its likely use of _S.O.P.s_ for its core GDS platform operations (which must be stable and reliable) versus the _Mutual Adjustment_ needed in its R&D and innovation teams (like those for "SabreMosaic").
        
- **Mechanistic vs. Organic Structures:** Where does each company sit on the spectrum?
    
    - Argue that KPMG's Audit function is necessarily _Mechanistic_ (tall, centralized, SOP-driven) to ensure quality and compliance.
        
    - Argue that its Advisory function must be _Organic_ (flatter, decentralized, mutual adjustment) to be agile and responsive to unique client problems.
        
    - Similarly, argue that Sabre's core platform operations are _Mechanistic_, while its new product development is _Organic_.
        

#### 3. Synthesis: The Strategy-Structure Fit

Your final analysis should answer: How well does each company's organizational structure _support_ its unique strategy?

- **Key Question for KPMG:** How does its _Multi-domestic network structure_ (the design) successfully support its _differentiation strategy_ (the goal) across dozens of unique legal and cultural markets?
    
- **Key Question for Sabre:** How does its _functional/product-based structure_ (the design) allow it to execute its _global platform strategy_ (the goal) and drive "customer-centric innovation"?
