### Pidilite's Business Model

Pidilite's business model is built on two primary operating segments: **Consumer & Bazaar** and **Business to Business**. This dual approach allows the company to serve a wide range of customers, from individual consumers to large industrial clients.

- **Consumer & Bazaar:** This segment is the key revenue driver, encompassing a strong portfolio of household names like **Fevicol**, **Fevikwik**, **Dr. Fixit**, and **Roff**. The company's market leadership in adhesives, sealants, and construction chemicals is a direct result of these iconic brands.
    
- **Business to Business:** This segment includes a wide range of products like **Industrial Adhesives, Industrial Resins, Construction Chemicals, Organic Pigments, and Pigment Preparations**. This segment serves various industries, including **packaging, textiles, paints, printing inks, paper, and leather**.
    
- **Innovation & Distribution:** Pidilite's success is also driven by its **innovation-driven model**, with a continuous focus on R&D for product development. This is supported by a **wide distribution network** that ensures its products are available in urban, rural, and international markets. The company has major international subsidiaries in key locations like Dubai, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Egypt, which are crucial for its global presence.

### Vision & Mission

Pidilite's vision and mission are rooted in a commitment to innovation, customer satisfaction, and global expansion.

- **Vision:** Pidilite aims to be the leading global hub for research and technical expertise, driving "innovation-driven" growth for the entire Pidilite Group of Companies worldwide.
    
- **Mission:** To achieve its vision, the company has a three-pronged mission:

    2. **Customer Focus:** Support and satisfy all valuable customers with innovative products and excellent technical competency.
        
    3. **Collaborative Innovation:** Partner with customers to provide complete product satisfaction and foster business growth together.


### Common Size Financial Statements

Pidilite's financial performance, as seen through the common size statements, exhibits a **"U-shaped" recovery**, demonstrating the company's resilience.

- **The Decline (2020-2022):** This period saw a decline in profitability, largely influenced by the after-effects of the pandemic and a global slowdown. The company also faced rising input costs and integration-related adjustments due to the Cipy Polyurethanes & Pidilite Adhesives merger.
    
- **The Recovery (2023 onwards):** The company rebounded strongly from 2023, driven by a market rebound, effective post-merger synergies, strong brand performance, and international expansion. By fiscal year 2025, **Total Income** had returned to its pre-decline levels.
    

**Margins**

- **Initial Strength and Subsequent Drop:** Margins were strong in 2020–2021 (~24–26%). They experienced a sharp decline to ~16–18% in 2022–2023 due to a combination of rising input costs, the global slowdown, and one-time merger integration costs.
    
- **Return to Stability:** A steady recovery began in 2023 and continued through 2025, with margins reaching pre-decline levels. This reflects the successful realization of synergies from acquisitions and a revival in market demand. The consistent **margin gap between EBITDA, EBIT, and PBT** (~2–3%) highlights the company's strong financial discipline.
    

**Overall:** The analysis of the common size statements reveals a company that successfully navigated significant short-term pressures, integrated major acquisitions, and restored its long-term margin sustainability, proving the effectiveness of its strategic initiatives.


### Comparative Financial Statements

Pidilite's year-on-year (YoY) performance showcases a **V-shaped recovery** in revenue and a strong rebound in profitability, particularly in fiscal year 2024.

- **Revenue Growth:** Revenue growth experienced a dip in FY21 at **-1.8%** due to the pandemic. It then had a sharp rebound of **+43.1%** in FY22, fueled by a market recovery and the consolidation of mergers. This was followed by a normalization phase with more moderate growth of **+5.4%** in FY24 and **+8.1%** in FY25, indicating a return to a sustainable, organic growth trajectory.
    
- **Profit After Tax (PAT) Growth:** PAT growth was initially muted, with modest increases of **+10.2%** in FY22 and **+5.5%** in FY23, as the company absorbed merger integration costs. However, in FY24, PAT saw a significant surge of **+43.1%**, which was not only driven by efficiency gains and merger synergies but also by a substantial increase in **Other Income** from gains on financial assets. This high growth was followed by a healthy and stable **+15.3%** increase in FY25, demonstrating the company's long-term profitability and efficiency gains.

### Impact of Mergers

During the fiscal year of 2022-2023, Pidilite had filed two merger applications with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for the merger of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, **Pidilite Adhesives Pvt. Ltd (PAPL)** and **Cipy Polyurethanes Pvt Ltd (CIPY)**.

The mergers became effective on April 1, 2022. As a result of this common control transaction, the financial statements for the previous year have been restated to account for the merger as if it had occurred from the beginning of the previous year. This restatement ensures that the financial figures accurately reflect the combined entity's performance.



### TREND ANALYSIS

### What to Say

- **Financial Growth:** Pidilite has demonstrated a **strong upward trend** in both its income statement and balance sheet. Over the period, **revenue** has grown by approximately 90% and **PAT** (Profit After Tax) by over 88%. This shows that the company is successfully translating top-line growth into bottom-line profits.
    
- **Strategic Asset Expansion:** The balance sheet shows a significant increase in **total assets** to **228%** of the 2020 base. This growth is a result of strategic investments in **Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)**, which grew to 243%, and a notable increase in **Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets** from mergers. This highlights the company’s focus on expanding its physical infrastructure and acquiring valuable intellectual property to drive future growth.


### RATIO ANALYSIS:-

### Profitability Ratios

- **Net Profit Margin (NPM):** The NPM shows a "U-shaped" trend, dipping in 2022-2023 due to a sharp rise in the cost of raw materials and post-merger integration costs. However, it rebounded strongly by 2025, reaching **98.75%** of its 2020 base. This reflects the company’s ability to effectively manage expenses and restore profitability.
    
- **Return on Equity (ROE):** ROE followed a similar pattern, declining in 2022 and 2023 before recovering to **93.32%** by 2025. The recovery indicates that the company is effectively utilizing shareholder funds to generate profits.
    
- **Return on Total Assets (ROA):** ROA also reflects a U-shaped recovery. It reached a low of **72.67%** in 2023 before rebounding to **89.19%** by 2025, showing the company's improved efficiency in generating profit from its total assets.

### Liquidity and Solvency Ratios

- **Current Ratio:** The current ratio has shown a steady improvement from **0.50** in 2021 to **0.89** in 2025. While it remains below the ideal level of 1, the improving trend signifies a strengthening ability to meet short-term obligations.
    
- **Total Debt to Equity Ratio:** This ratio has remained stable around **0.40**, indicating that the company's reliance on debt has been consistent and well-managed despite significant expansion and acquisitions. This reflects a healthy capital structure.
    

---

### Cash Performance and Efficiency Ratios

- **Cash Return on Equity (Cash from Operations/Average Shareholders' Equity):** This ratio demonstrates a U-shaped recovery, similar to the other profitability ratios. The rebound indicates that Pidilite is generating strong cash flows from its core operations, providing a robust return to shareholders.
    
- **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):** The CCC has improved, declining to **78.02%** of its 2020 base by 2025. This shows that the company has become more efficient in converting its inventory and receivables into cash.
    
- **Operating Expense to Sales:** This ratio shows an initial decline and then a recovery, which is a good sign as it means operating expenses are being controlled relative to sales, contributing to the rebound in profitability.


### Interpretation

Looking at the financial highlights, we can see a clear story of strategic success. The data shows a powerful surge in both our top and bottom-line performance, which began right after the mergers in 2022 and 2023. This isn't just organic growth; it's a direct reflection of how effective our acquisitions of **Cipy Polyurethanes** and **Pidilite Adhesives** have been. They haven't just expanded our market share—they’ve added substantial and highly profitable business segments.

Our balance sheet also tells a story of strategic investment. The sharp increase in **Goodwill** and **Other Intangible Assets** in 2022 directly reflects the value we gained from these mergers, including key brands like Araldite. This demonstrates our commitment to a growth strategy that secures our market position and intellectual property for the long term.

Furthermore, our financial highlights show a deliberate shift in how we manage our finances. We’ve been very successful in de-leveraging, as shown by the fact that our short-term borrowings have been completely eliminated in recent years. This, coupled with our stable **Total Debt to Equity Ratio**, indicates a highly disciplined approach to managing financial risk. We are funding our growth through strong internal cash generation, which is a very healthy sign.

Finally, the fluctuations in our cash reserves are not a concern; they show that we are actively putting our cash to work. We are using our liquidity for strategic investments and managing our financial health proactively to support our long-term goals."


### Conclusion

Building upon the financial and operational strengths of recent years, Pidilite Industries is strategically positioned for a future of sustained growth and market leadership. The company's future-oriented strategy is built on key pillars that have been consistently highlighted in its annual reports.

First, **Digital and Technological Advancement**. Pidilite is committed to leveraging technology to enhance efficiency and customer experience. This includes modernizing its IT infrastructure and using analytics to drive growth. A great example of this is the company's digital transformation in Bangladesh, which helped overcome economic challenges and contributed to a 9% volume growth.

Second, **International Expansion**. The company continues to strengthen its presence in international markets. In Bangladesh, a key market, Pidilite launched a new manufacturing facility for its Roff brand to localize production and further increase its market share. This strategy of expanding into new territories, as seen with ROFF in Bangladesh, demonstrates a long-term vision for global growth.

Third, **Sustainability and Responsible Business**. Pidilite has consistently embedded Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into its core business model. The company's initiatives focus on reducing energy and water usage, controlling greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting renewable energy. Its CSR programs support community well-being through initiatives in education, skill development, and water conservation.

Lastly, **Brand Leadership and Innovation**. The company's brand-building campaigns for key products like **Fevicol**, **Dr. Fixit**, and **Roff**, combined with social media engagement, continue to reinforce its category leadership. Pidilite also focuses on raising awareness about the importance of high-quality products, such as in its waterproofing campaign, to ensure structural durability and health.

In conclusion, Pidilite Industries is not only a strong financial performer but also a forward-thinking company. By investing in digital capabilities, expanding its global footprint, upholding its commitment to sustainability, and reinforcing its brand leadership through innovation, Pidilite is well-equipped to navigate future challenges and create long-term value for all stakeholders.
